# Summary

E-VA is a comprehensive women's wellness desktop App with features such as period tracking, mood & symptom tracking, as well as a health library. E-VA's focus is to enable women to become increasingly aware of their health and wellness. Through an interactive calendar, women can analyse their data, compare them monthly, and can identify certain patterns to detect any change that may serve as an alert for them to see a doctor.
